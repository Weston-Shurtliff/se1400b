        <h2>Who are we?</h2>
        <p class="body">We are small business owners who are trying to grow our business and have a fun time doing it. We started as a team at a competition called Code Camp trying to make a game. After we made that game we made a logo and 3d printed it and that gave us an idea. What if we sold items that we made online? That is how we got together to make this amazing business.</p>
        <h2>Who are we exactly?</h2>
        <p class="body">Some of you might be asking "Ok, you told me how you met and came to be but you havn't told us who you are." to that I would reply with "You are completly correct!". So to get that issue out of the way let me introduce us so you can know where this is all coming from.</p>
        <h2>Lanae Shurtliff</h2>
        <p class="body">Creative, fun, willing to do work, and loves to draw</p>
        <h2>Travis Shurtliff</h2>
        <p class="body">Smart, loves to code, always wants to help, and very caring</p>
