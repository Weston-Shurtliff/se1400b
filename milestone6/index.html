        <h2>The Pink Kitties</h2>
        <p>The Pink Kitties is a locally owned small business who sell products (and potentially make games) and try to meet customer satisfaction by makeing changes based on customer comments and complaints. Unless it is something unreasonable like "Oh no, my package came slightly damaged!" We can't do anything about shiping because we are not a shiping company. If we receve complaints about our website we will (respond with "its absolutly perfect and our website designer is dashingly handome and perfect in all ways so he couldn't have made any mistakes" Deffenently) try to fix the problem if it is major enough and not some personal preference.</p>
        <h2>Why us?</h2>
        <p>You might be thinking to yourself "Why would I chose The Pink Kitties?" Let me answer that question for you by providing you with some evedence. We want you to be a happy customer and will do things to make your products come in perfect condition. If it is broken in transportation we will send you another one for a slight fee (because shipping is quite expensive, Sorry). We also accept returns if the product isnt what you expected or if you didn't want it. We only want the best products for our customers so expect the best products to come from us because we strive to make them the best we can.</p>
